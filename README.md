# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Over the last few weeks, I have been engaged in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. Throughout the course, I have been documenting my notes and learnings on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@codex-ventures) page on the various stages of the data analysis process. Now, to bring the course to a close, Google suggests that each student completes a Capstone Project that exemplifies the technical abilities they have acquired from the course and also exhibits their understanding of each stage of the data analysis process. In accordance with this recommendation, I have completed my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Case Study.




## Context

As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a bike-share firm based in Chicago, I am considered to be part of the marketing analyst team. The director of marketing considers that the company's prosperity hinges on maximizing the number of yearly subscriptions. To achieve this objective, your team aims to comprehend the distinct usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by casual riders and annual members. The information gleaned from this analysis will be used to create a new marketing plan to convert occasional riders into regular members. However, before the suggestions can be implemented, they must be endorsed by Cyclistic executives. Hence, the recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
